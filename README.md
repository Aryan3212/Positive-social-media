# Positive-social-media
A social media that inspires positivity and does not force any news upon you.

You can only 'vote' on a post, which means nobody can react HaHa on your profile picture.

Nobody can comment, so you don't have to worry about rude comments.

Clone the repo using

`` git clone https://github.com/Aryan3212/Positive-social-media.git ```

You must have git installed on your device to run this command on your device. This will essentially copy all the files 
from this repo and make a copy of it on your machine.

Note that you must have a MySQL database running on port 3306 to run the app.

Currently, only the RESTful API has been implemented that can query the necessary info from the database.
